# Kubernetes API Server

The Kubernetes API Server is a central component of the Kubernetes control plane. It serves as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane and is responsible for exposing the Kubernetes API. The API Server performs several crucial functions:

1. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users or services making requests.
2. **Authorization**: Checks if the authenticated entity has the necessary permissions.
3. **Request validation**: Ensures incoming requests are properly formatted and contain valid data.
4. **Data retrieval and storage**: Interacts with etcd (the cluster's distributed key-value store) to read and write cluster state information.
5. **Communication with other components**: Informs the scheduler about new pods that need to be scheduled and notifies kubelet (the node agent) about changes that affect its node.

> **Note**: The API Server is the only component that can read and write to the etcd database.



# Kubernetes Controller Manager

The Kubernetes Controller Manager is a core component of the Kubernetes control plane. It runs controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster. The Controller Manager performs several crucial functions:

1. **State management**: Continuously monitors the cluster's current state and works to maintain the desired state.
2. **Resource control**: Manages various Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, and replication controllers.
3. **Lifecycle operations**: Handles operations like scaling, updating, and deleting resources.
4. **Background tasks**: Performs routine cluster maintenance tasks.
5. **Coordination**: Works in conjunction with the API Server and Scheduler to ensure proper cluster operation.

> **Note**: The Controller Manager runs multiple controllers in a single process for efficiency, but each controller is logically independent.
