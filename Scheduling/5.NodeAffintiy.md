## Node Affinity

Node affinity is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes. It's conceptually similar to taints and tolerations but with the opposite effect - it attracts pods to nodes instead of repelling them.

There are two types of node affinity:

1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

### Adding labels to a Node:

```bash
kubectl label nodes node1 disktype=ssd
```

### Node Affinity in Pod Specification:

#### Example 1: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: required-affinity-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd 
          - key: size
            operator: In
            values:
            - large
            - medium 
  containers:
  - name: main-container
    image: my-image
```

This example demonstrates a pod that requires nodes with both `disktype=ssd` and `size=large` labels.

#### Example 2: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd 
          weight: 1 
        - preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: In
            values:
            - large 
          weight: 10
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

This example demonstrates a pod that prefers nodes with `disktype=ssd` and `size=large` labels, with a higher preference for nodes with `size=large` labels.
