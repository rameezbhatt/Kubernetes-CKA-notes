# DaemonSets in Kubernetes

## What are DaemonSets?

DaemonSets are a Kubernetes resource that ensures a copy of a pod runs on all (or some) nodes in a cluster. They're useful for deploying system daemons or agents that need to run on every node, such as:

- Logging collectors
- Monitoring agents
- Node-level security tools

Key features:
- Automatically creates a pod on new nodes added to the cluster
- Removes pods from nodes that are removed from the cluster
- Ensures one pod per node (for the DaemonSet)

## Example

Here's a simple example of a DaemonSet that deploys a logging agent:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: logging-agent
  namespace: logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: logging-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: logging-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: logging-agent
        image: logging-agent-image
```

This DaemonSet will ensure that a pod running the `logging-agent-image` is deployed on every node in the `logging` namespace.

## Important Notes

- DaemonSets are cluster-level resources, not namespaced
- They can be configured to run on specific nodes using nodeSelector or nodeAffinity
- They can also be configured to run on a subset of nodes using a label selector
- DaemonSets are automatically scaled up or down based on the number of nodes in the cluster

## Useful Commands for DaemonSets

1. Create a DaemonSet:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
   ```

2. List all DaemonSets:
   ```
   kubectl get daemonsets
   ```

3. Describe a specific DaemonSet:
   ```
   kubectl describe daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```

4. Delete a DaemonSet:
   ```
   kubectl delete daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```

5. Update a DaemonSet:
   ```
   kubectl edit daemonset <daemonset-name>
   ```

6. Check the status of DaemonSet pods:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -l name=<daemonset-label>
   ```

7. View DaemonSet logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs daemonset/<daemonset-name>
   ```

Remember that DaemonSets are powerful tools for ensuring certain pods run on all nodes, but use them judiciously to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
