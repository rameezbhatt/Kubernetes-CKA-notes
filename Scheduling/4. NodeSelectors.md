# NodeSelectors

NodeSelectors are a simple way to constrain Pods to specific Nodes in Kubernetes. They work by matching labels on Nodes to selectors specified in the Pod.


## Example

Suppose we want to schedule a Pod on a Node with an SSD:

1. Label the Node:
   ```
   kubectl label nodes <node-name> disk=ssd
   ```

2. Use NodeSelector in Pod specification:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
     nodeSelector:
       disk: ssd
   ```

## Useful Commands

1. Label a Node:
   ```
   kubectl label nodes node1 size=large
   ```

2. View Node labels:
   ```
   kubectl get nodes --show-labels
   ```

3. Remove a label from a Node:
   ```
   kubectl label nodes node1 size-
   ```

4. List Pods with their Node selectors:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -o wide --show-labels
   ```
