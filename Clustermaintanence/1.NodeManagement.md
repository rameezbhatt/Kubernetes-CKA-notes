# Kubernetes Node Management: Drain, Cordon, and Uncordon

## Drain

Draining a node evicts all pods (except DaemonSets) and marks it as unschedulable.

### Example:

```bash
kubectl drain node-1 --ignore-daemonsets --force
```

### Explanation:
- Evicts all pods from the node
- New pods will not be scheduled on this node
- Useful for safely draining a node for maintenance

## Cordon

Cordoning a node marks it as unschedulable, preventing new pods from being scheduled onto it.

### Example:
```bash
kubectl cordon node-1

### Explanation:
- Existing pods continue to run on the node
- New pods will not be scheduled on this node
- Useful for preparing a node for maintenance


## Uncordon

Uncordoning a node marks it as schedulable, allowing new pods to be scheduled onto it.

### Example:

```bash
kubectl uncordon node-1
```

### Explanation:
- Existing pods continue to run on the node
- New pods will be scheduled on this node
- Useful for resuming normal operations after maintenance
