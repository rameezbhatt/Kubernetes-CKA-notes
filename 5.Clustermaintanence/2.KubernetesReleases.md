# Kubernetes Releases

Kubernetes follows a structured release cycle to provide new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## Release Cadence

- Major releases: Approximately every 4 months
- Minor releases: As needed for critical bug fixes and security updates

## Version Numbering

Kubernetes uses semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
- X: Major version
- Y: Minor version
- Z: Patch version

## Release Channels

- Alpha: Experimental features, may be buggy
- Beta: Features are well-tested but may have minor issues
- Stable: Production-ready features

## Support Window

- Each minor release is typically supported for 12 months
- At any given time, three minor releases are supported

## Upgrading

- It's recommended to upgrade one minor version at a time
- Always check the release notes for breaking changes and new features

## End-of-Life (EOL)

- After a version reaches EOL, it no longer receives updates or security patches
- Plan to upgrade before your current version reaches EOL
