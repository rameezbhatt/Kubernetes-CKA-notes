# Kubelet

Kubelet is an essential agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for managing the containers running on individual nodes. The Kubelet performs several important functions:

1. **Pod lifecycle management**: Ensures that containers described in PodSpecs are running and healthy.
2. **Resource monitoring**: Tracks and reports node and pod resource usage.
3. **Container runtime interface**: Interacts with the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) to manage containers.
4. **Node status reporting**: Regularly reports the node's status to the control plane.
5. **Volume management**: Mounts and unmounts volumes for pods.

# Kube-Proxy

Kube-Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for maintaining network rules that allow communication to and from pods. Kube-Proxy performs several important functions:

1. **Service abstraction**: Implements the Kubernetes Service concept, providing a way to access pods.
2. **Load balancing**: Distributes network traffic among pod replicas for a service.
3. **IP table rules management**: Manages iptables rules to handle routing and NAT for pods.
4. **Service discovery**: Enables pods to discover and communicate with services in the cluster.
5. **Health checking**: Monitors the health of services and updates routing rules accordingly.
