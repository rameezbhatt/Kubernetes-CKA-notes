# Kubernetes API Server

The Kubernetes API Server is a central component of the Kubernetes control plane. It serves as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane and is responsible for exposing the Kubernetes API. The API Server performs several crucial functions:

1. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users or services making requests.
2. **Authorization**: Checks if the authenticated entity has the necessary permissions.
3. **Request validation**: Ensures incoming requests are properly formatted and contain valid data.
4. **Data retrieval and storage**: Interacts with etcd (the cluster's distributed key-value store) to read and write cluster state information.
5. **Communication with other components**: Informs the scheduler about new pods that need to be scheduled and notifies kubelet (the node agent) about changes that affect its node.

> **Note**: The API Server is the only component that can read and write to the etcd database.
