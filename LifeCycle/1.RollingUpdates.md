# Rolling Updates and Rollback in Kubernetes

## Rolling Updates

Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones. The new Pods will be scheduled on Nodes with available resources.

### Key features:
- Gradual process: Updates a few pods at a time
- Zero downtime: Service remains available during the update
- Configurable: Control the rate of the update

### How it works:
1. New ReplicaSet is created with updated Pod template
2. Pods are gradually moved from old ReplicaSet to new one
3. Traffic is load-balanced between old and new Pods

## Rollback

Rollback reverts a Deployment to a previous revision. It's useful when the current version is problematic.

### Key features:
- Quick recovery: Revert to a known good state
- Versioned: Kubernetes keeps track of Deployment revisions
- Configurable: Can rollback to a specific version

### How it works:
1. Previous ReplicaSet is scaled up
2. Current ReplicaSet is scaled down
3. Deployment returns to the previous state

## Commands

- Perform a rolling update:
  ```
  kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myimage:v2
  ```

- Check rollout status:
  ```
  kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
  ```

- Rollback to the previous revision:
  ```
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
  ```

- Rollback to a specific revision:
  ```
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp --to-revision=2
  ```

Rolling updates and rollbacks are powerful features in Kubernetes that help maintain application availability and reliability during the deployment lifecycle.
