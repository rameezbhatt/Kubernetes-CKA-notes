# Multiple Schedulers in Kubernetes

## Basic Explanation

In Kubernetes, a scheduler is responsible for deciding where to place pods (containers) on the available nodes (machines) in your cluster. By default, Kubernetes uses a single scheduler. However, MultipleSchedulers allows you to use more than one scheduler in your cluster. This can be useful when you want different scheduling rules for different types of workloads or when you want to customize how certain pods are placed on nodes.

## Multiple Scheduler Profiles Example

Let's illustrate this with a simple example using scheduler profiles. Scheduler profiles allow you to configure different scheduling behaviors without creating entirely separate schedulers.

Here's an example of how you might define multiple scheduler profiles in your kube-scheduler configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- schedulerName: default-scheduler
- schedulerName: high-priority-scheduler
plugins:
  score:
    disabled:
      name: NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation
    enabled:
      name: NodePreferAvoidPods
      weight: 1000
```

In this example, we have two profiles:
- `default`: This profile enables default preemption, which allows the scheduler to preempt lower priority pods to make room for higher priority pods.
- `high-priority`: This profile disables preemption, meaning it will not preempt lower priority pods.

To use these profiles, you would start the kube-scheduler with the `--config` flag pointing to the above configuration file.

## Schedulers Profile

In this example, we have two profiles:

## Useful Commands

1. To view the current scheduler configuration:
   ```
   kubectl get configmap kube-scheduler -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```

2. To check which scheduler assigned a pod:
   ```
   kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.schedulerName}'
   ```

3. To view scheduler events:
   ```
   kubectl get events --field-selector reason=Scheduled
   ```

4. To check the status of the scheduler:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep scheduler
   ```

5. To view scheduler logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <scheduler-pod-name>
   ```

These commands can help you manage and troubleshoot multiple schedulers in your Kubernetes cluster.
