# Static Pods in Kubernetes

## What are Static Pods?

Static Pods are pods that are managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node, without the API server observing or managing them. They're created by placing a pod definition file in a designated directory on the node.

Key points:
- Controlled by kubelet, not the API server
- Tied to a specific node
- Cannot use ConfigMaps or Secrets

## Example

Here's a simple example of a Static Pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: static-web
  labels:
    role: web
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 80
```

To create this Static Pod:
1. Save this YAML file on the node (e.g., `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-web.yaml`)
2. Configure kubelet to watch this directory
3. Restart kubelet

## Useful Commands

1. Find the Static Pod manifest directory:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status kubelet
   ```
   Look for `--pod-manifest-path` or `--manifest-url` in the output

2. List Static Pods on a node:
   ```
   docker ps | grep static
   ```

3. View Static Pod details:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep <node-name>
   ```

4. Delete a Static Pod:
   Remove or rename the pod's manifest file in the manifest directory on the node

Remember: You can't delete Static Pods using kubectl delete commands!
