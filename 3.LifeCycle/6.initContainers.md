# Init Containers in Kubernetes

Init containers are specialized containers that run before app containers in a Kubernetes Pod. They are used to perform initialization tasks before the main application containers start.

## Key Features

1. Run to completion before app containers start
2. Execute sequentially (if multiple init containers are specified)
3. Must complete successfully for the Pod to be considered ready
4. Can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in app images

## Use Cases

- Run setup scripts or download required files
- Wait for external services to be available
- Populate shared volumes with configuration or data
- Register the Pod with a central database

## Example

Here's an example of a Pod with an init container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: myapp-pod
 labels:
 app: myapp
spec:
 containers:
   -name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
 initContainers:
   - name: init-myservice
     image: busybox:1.28
     command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup myservice.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done"]
```

In this example:
- The init container `init-myservice` checks for the availability of a service named `myservice` using `nslookup`.
- It keeps retrying until the service is found.
- Only after the init container completes successfully will the main `myapp-container` start.

## Best Practices

1. Keep init containers lightweight and fast-executing.
2. Use init containers for tasks that need to be completed before the main app starts.
3. Handle failures gracefully, as failed init containers will cause the Pod to restart.
4. Use the `restartPolicy` field to control restart behavior.

## Limitations

- Init containers don't support `lifecycle`, `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, or `startupProbe`.
- Resource requests and limits for init containers are handled differently from app containers.

Init containers are a powerful feature in Kubernetes for ensuring your main application starts in a fully prepared environment.
