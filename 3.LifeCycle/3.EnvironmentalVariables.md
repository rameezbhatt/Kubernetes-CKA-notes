# Environmental Variables in Kubernetes

Environmental variables are a way to pass configuration data to containers running in a Kubernetes cluster. They allow you to decouple configuration from your application code, making it easier to manage and deploy applications across different environments.

## Basic Usage

You can define environment variables directly in the Pod or Deployment specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
    name: example-container
    image: example-image
    env:
      - name: DATABASE_URL
        value: "mysql://user:password@database:3306/mydb"
      - name: API_KEY
        value: "abcdef123456"



## Using ConfigMaps for Environment Variables

ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content. You can use ConfigMaps to store environment variables and inject them into your Pods.

1. Create a ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  APP_COLOR: blue
  APP_MODE: prod
```

2. Use the ConfigMap in a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: config-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: app-image
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: app-config
```

This will create environment variables for each key-value pair in the ConfigMap.

You can also reference individual values from a ConfigMap:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: app-image
    env:
    - name: COLOR
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: app-config
          key: APP_COLOR
```

## Benefits of Using Environment Variables

1. **Flexibility**: Easily change configuration without modifying the application code.
2. **Security**: Sensitive information can be managed separately from the application.
3. **Portability**: Applications can run in different environments without code changes.

## Best Practices

1. Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration data.
2. Use Secrets for sensitive data (like passwords and API keys).
3. Keep environment variables specific to the application they're used in.
4. Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions.

By leveraging environment variables and ConfigMaps, you can create more flexible and maintainable Kubernetes deployments.
