# ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. It's often used indirectly through Deployments, which manage ReplicaSets.

## Creating ReplicaSets

To create a ReplicaSet:

kubectl create -f replicaset-definition.yaml

## Getting ReplicaSets

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

## Deleting ReplicaSets

To delete a ReplicaSet:

```bash
kubectl delete replicaset replicaset-name
```

## Scaling ReplicaSets

To scale a ReplicaSet:

```bash
kubectl scale replicaset replicaset-name --replicas=new-replica-count
```

## Describe ReplicaSets

To describe a ReplicaSet:

```bash
kubectl describe replicaset replicaset-name
```

# Deployments

A Deployment is a higher-level resource that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods. It's used to define how an application should be deployed, scaled, and maintained.

## Creating Deployments

To create a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx
```

## Getting Deployments

To get the status of a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

## Scaling Deployments

To scale a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment deployment-name --replicas=new-replica-count
```

## Describe Deployments

To describe a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment deployment-name
```     

## Rolling Updates

Deployments support rolling updates, which allow you to update your application without downtime.

To perform a rolling update:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/deployment-name nginx=nginx:1.15.1
```

## Rollback

To rollback a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment-name
```
