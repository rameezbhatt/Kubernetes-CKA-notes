# Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

## What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines (nodes) that work together to orchestrate and run containerized applications.
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containers. 
The cluster consists of at least one master node and multiple worker nodes.

## Cluster Components

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two main types of nodes:
 the Control Plane (Master Node) and Worker Nodes.
  Here's a breakdown of their components and functions:

### 1. Control Plane (Master Node)

The control center of the cluster, responsible for orchestrating and coordinating all cluster activities.
It comprises of following components:

#### API Server
- Acts as the front door for the cluster
- Handles all requests and commands
- Validates and processes API requests

#### Scheduler
- Decides which node should run new pods
- Considers resources, constraints, and policies

#### Controller Manager
- Monitors the cluster state
- Ensures the actual state matches the desired state
- Includes various controllers (e.g., Node, Replication)

#### etcd
- Distributed key-value store
- Holds all cluster data and state information

### 2. Worker Nodes

Machines that run the actual containerized applications and workloads as orchestrated by the master node.
Comprises of following components:

#### Kubelet
- Ensures containers are running in a pod
- Reports node and pod status to the API server

#### Container Runtime
- Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd)
- Pulls images and starts/stops containers

#### Kube-proxy
- Maintains network rules on the node
- Enables communication between pods and external traffic
